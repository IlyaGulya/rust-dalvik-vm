# Rust Dalvik VM

## Introduction

This is a project I'm writing purely for educational purposes.

## Plan

[ ] Parse DEX file (I'm aware of `dexparser` crate, but I want to do it myself to better understand DEX file structure)
[ ] Be able to interpret simple DEX file (`hello.dex` in `tests/vm/hello.dex`, compiled
from `tests/interpreter/hello.smali`)
[ ] Memory allocations?
[ ] Garbage collection?
[ ] JIT?
[ ] AOT?
[ ] JNI?
[ ] Debugging?
[ ] Something else I'm currently not aware of ðŸ˜€
